This is the recipe for baking a red velvet cake.
Essentially it’s a chocolate cake made with little cocoa powder. The cocoa reacts with the acidic vinegar and buttermilk, and in turn keeps the cake moist, light, and fluffy. The chocolate taste is fairly mild but the flavours are delicately rich. Essentially it’s a chocolate cake made with little cocoa powder.
